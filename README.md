# streamsx.topology
A project that supports building streaming topologies (applications)
for InfoSphere Streams in different programming languages, such as Java.

## Java API for IBM Streams
The streamsx.topology API enables a developer to create streaming applications entirely in Java for IBM Streams. Streamsx.topology employs a functional style of programming -- a developer may define a graph's flow and data manipulation simultaneously.
